DwarfHeightmap
==============

Dwarf Fortress Heightmap Generator, written in 2008, long abandoned!

It's here if you want to see how things were built. I think it was originally compiled with Visual Studio Express 2005 - it might need some work to make it compile again.

The map data that it exports was originally written for a much earlier version of Dwarf Fortress, so files generated by it will need to be tweaked.
